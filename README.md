# Your Platform to Preserve Private On-chain Identity

Welcome to our platform, a decentralized application designed to help you preserve your private on-chain identity. This project was submitted for the third edition of **Franklin Templeton Blockchain Contest**.

  
## Getting Started

To get started with **VeriFlex**, you can either:
+ Visit veriflex.vercel.app to seamlessly interact with the app and generate Soul Bound Token for your account in Sepolia Testnet
+ Build the app from scratch by following instructions below

If you just want to visit Vercel-hosted page, move to subchapter 3. Explore the Platform.


## Work Directories

  

This project consists of two main directories:

  

1.  `packages/contracts` - This directory contains all the smart contracts that power our platform.

2.  `packages/app` - This directory contains the frontend application that allows you to interact with the blockchain.
 

### 1. Backend Setup

  

Navigate to the `packages/contracts` directory:

  

```bash

cd packages/contracts

```

  
Install needed dependencies:

  

```bash

npm install

```

  

Next, start the Hardhat node:

  

```bash

npx hardhat node

```

  

This will open a port to listen for incoming transactions. **Do not close this terminal!**

  

In a new terminal window, deploy the smart contracts:

  

```bash

npm run deploy

```

  

Our platform is based on the Ethereum blockchain. To interact with it, you'll need to install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and add the localhost test network to it.

  

**RPC:**

  

```bash
Network name: Localhost

RPC URL: http://localhost:8545

Chain ID: 1337

Currency symbol: ETH
```

  

### 2. Frontend Setup

  

Navigate to the `packages/app` directory:

  

```bash

cd packages/app

```

  

Install needed dependencies:

  

```bash

npm install

```

  

Then, start the Next.js application:

  

```bash

npm run dev

```

  

### 3. Explore the Platform

  

Before interacting with the platform, your current wallet needs to have funds on the network. Here is quick rundown on how to fund your wallet:
+ **Localhost** (*app was run using commands above*): Copy private key from one of 20 generated accounts with npx hardhat node and paste it into your MetaMask (Choose account -> Add account or hardware wallet -> Import). After that  navigate to `localhost:3000`.
+ **Sepolia**: Visit this [faucet](#head1234) powered by Google's Cloud Web3 Provider to obtain free Sepolia ETH to operate on VeriFlex.

Connect your wallet using the button at the top of the page.

Now, you're all set to explore the platform and preserve your private on-chain identity!

  
## Pages

### Issuer:

  

Here you can mint your own SBT. This SBT is predefined to prove you are over 18.

  

### Holder:

  

After connecting your wallet, you can see there is one SBT by default (it's just a placeholder). After minting your SBT with Issuer, you can see it in this page. To prove and verify it, just click the verify button.

  

‚ùó *Note*: If you are experiencing issues when minting or performing any other operation regarding smart contracts - switch network to other and then switch back to localhost. It will restart local state and will sync with hardhat blockchain instance.

*Please note that the local/Sepolia testnet blockchain is for testing purposes only. Always ensure that you're connected to the correct network before making any transactions.*

  

We hope you enjoy using our platform. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
